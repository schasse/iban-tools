# Data from http://www.swift.com/dsp/resources/documents/IBAN_Registry.pdf
# And the parsed, readable table on
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number
#
# The values of the hashes follow the rules in the IBAN_Registry PDF:
#
# Length:
# nn! - mixed length
# nn  - maximum length
#
# Character representation
# n - Digits (numeric characters 0 to 9 only)
# a - Upper case letters (alphabetic characters A-Z only)
# c - Upper and lower case alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z and 0-9)
# e - blank space
#
# If a field has more than one kind of character representation, an array can
# be used (see MU)
